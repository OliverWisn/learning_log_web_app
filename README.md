# Web Application "Learning Log"

## Motivation:
I make this web application because I'm interested in how websites are 
made. For this purpose, I would like to use the Django framework. 

## Rights:
This web application is made on the basis of the book "Python Crash 
Course - A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming" by 
Eric Matthes. The autor of the book give me the right, I quote, "to 
share the code you wrote for the exercises in the book to show people 
what you have learned", but he give me one stipulation, I quote, "as 
long as you're not trying to create a learning resource based largely 
on the material from this book". So please don't create a learning 
resource from this material.

## Requirements: 
python 3.10.2 - rest in requirements.txt .

## Remarks:
- I make this script so that the master branch has always the 
  functioning code.

## Web Application Summary:
This application will be an online diary system to monitor what 
the user has learned on certain topics. It will allow users to save 
information of interest and thus add entries to the journal when 
learning a new topic. After logging in, the user will be able to 
create a new topic, add a new entry, as well as read and edit existing 
entries. When you learn a new topic, keeping a diary of what you've 
learned can be helpful in monitoring your progress and reviewing 
the information you've gathered.

## Version:
- This is version 1.00 of the application.
